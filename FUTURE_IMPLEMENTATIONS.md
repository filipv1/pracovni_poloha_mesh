# Future Implementations

## 1. Calibration Phase at Video Start

### Concept
Implement a calibration routine where the worker performs specific neck movements at the beginning of the video to establish personalized baseline measurements.

### Calibration Sequence
1. **Neutral Position** (5 seconds)
   - Worker stands/sits in neutral posture
   - System captures baseline neck and trunk angles
   - Establishes "zero point" for measurements

2. **Maximum Neck Flexion** (3 seconds)
   - Worker performs maximum comfortable forward neck bend
   - System records personal maximum flexion angle
   - Creates upper bound for neck angle measurements

3. **Maximum Neck Extension** (3 seconds)
   - Worker tilts head back to comfortable maximum
   - System records personal maximum extension
   - Establishes range of motion

4. **Lateral Neck Flexion** (3 seconds each side)
   - Worker tilts head to left shoulder, then right
   - Captures lateral flexibility range

### Implementation Details
```python
class CalibrationManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.calibration_data = {
            'neutral_neck_angle': None,
            'max_flexion': None,
            'max_extension': None,
            'lateral_left': None,
            'lateral_right': None,
            'calibration_frames': [],
            'worker_height_estimate': None
        }
    
    def detect_calibration_phase(self, video_frames):
        """
        Automatically detect calibration movements in first 30 seconds
        Uses pose stability and movement patterns to identify calibration
        """
        pass
    
    def apply_calibration(self, raw_angles):
        """
        Adjust measured angles based on individual calibration
        Returns personalized ergonomic scores
        """
        pass
```

### Benefits
- **Personalized Thresholds**: Instead of fixed 60° threshold, use percentage of individual's range
- **Accommodation for Differences**: Accounts for age, flexibility, existing conditions
- **Better Accuracy**: Reduces false positives for people with limited range of motion
- **Baseline Drift Correction**: Can detect and correct for sensor/tracking drift over time

### Usage Example
```bash
# Run with calibration
python run_production_simple.py video.mp4 output/ --calibrate

# System prompts:
# "Calibration phase detected in frames 0-750"
# "Neutral position: 15°"
# "Max flexion: 65°"
# "Max extension: -20°"
# "Calibration applied to all measurements"
```

### Ergonomic Analysis Enhancement
Instead of reporting:
- "Neck angle > 60° for 120 seconds"

Report:
- "Neck flexion > 80% of personal maximum for 120 seconds"
- "Worker exceeded comfortable range by 15° on average"
